# **Sales Data Analysis Project**  

## **Overview**  
This project conducts an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a sales dataset to identify trends, seasonal variations, and product performance. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical summaries, and visualizations to gain insights into top-performing products, regions, and customer preferences.  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset consists of the following columns:  
- **Date**: Transaction date.  
- **Product_ID**: Unique product identifier.  
- **Product_Name**: Name of the product sold.  
- **Category**: Product type (Electronics, Accessories, etc.).  
- **Region**: Sales region (North, South, East, West).  
- **Sales_Amount**: Revenue generated from the product.  
- **Quantity_Sold**: Total units sold.  
- **Discount**: Discount percentage applied.  
- **Customer_Rating**: Product rating given by customers (out of 5).  

## **Analysis Workflow**  

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Read the dataset using `pandas`.  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Convert data types if required.  

2. **Statistical Analysis and Insights**  
   - Compute mean, median, and standard deviation.  
   - Identify best-selling products and high-revenue regions.  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - **Pie Charts**: Show sales distribution by region.  
   - **Bar Charts**: Highlight top-performing products.  
   - **Line Graphs**: Track sales trends over time.  

4. **Key Findings and Recommendations**  
   - Summarize insights based on sales patterns.  
   - Suggest pricing strategies and inventory improvements.  

## **Installation and Setup**  
To execute the analysis, install the required Python libraries:  
```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib
```  

## **Running the Project**  
1. Place `sales_data.csv` in the project directory.  
2. Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Execute all cells to process the data and generate visualizations.  

## **Expected Outputs**  
- **Pie Chart**: Sales distribution by region.  
- **Bar Graph**: Top-selling products.  
- **Summary Report**: Key insights from the analysis.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project helps businesses optimize pricing, target high-revenue products, and make data-driven decisions based on regional sales performance.
